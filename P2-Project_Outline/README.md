###Overview (first posted on Sandy Hadley's repository) 
A business recommendation and review site, akin to Yelp, which will focus on promotion and raising visibility of small, minority-, women-, and differently-abled-persons owned and run businesses. The site should help guide community and customer support and interest to small, diverse, independent businesses and orgs run/owned by the listed groups. A service of this type would be helpful for the conscious consumer: the person who is invested in buying/supporting as locally as is possible and building stable financial networks for often-disenfranchised or overlooked groups within their communities.

###Features
Search: User/potential customer can do a word search of the site for a needed good or service.

List: Lists businesses by tag, location, search, category, etc.

Customer Login: Customer uses discrete user identity to log in, create a profile page, pass on recommendations, and save favored businesses.

Customer Portal: Facilitate requests for listing of businesses, interactions with clients

Admin Portal: Ability to make changes to various aspects of the business profile

Business Opt-out: Functionality allows business owners themselves to opt out of participation in the service as desired, and at no cost.
